## Brief description
*Be Safe!* plataform presents an approach to the solution of the codehacks's problem, offering a solution to the new students of the NYU Stern School to find the best area to live based on safety, affordability and closeness.

In the first phase, the Kanban Methodology was used in order to specify the main tasks that would be carry out in this lapse of time to the technological, analytical and visualization requirements. So, Bootstrap, jQuery and Google Maps API libraries were used to make a map with the main locations was created and a first version of a navigation bar that allows access to the first functions developed.

For the analytical requeriments, the data of the four main data bases was obteined, and the districts and neighborhoods of New York was extracted from them.

By last, the application shows, with different colors, the 59 districts on a map provided by Google Maps The neighborhoods and the buildings, units and projects that there are in New York are showed too. And the first approach to develop a friendly user font-end UI was started, as support to move forward with the visualization requeriments.

## Structured description:

#### Map Visualization:

 1. Basic Map with specific location (your map is located in a meaningful place). **Yes**
 2. Markers for location of interest places **Yes** 
 3. Labels for interest places names **No**
 4. Window to show detail information of a interest place **No**
 5. [Describe] Any other cover on the map (for example, cloud cover to show the weather effect) **No**

#### Chart Visualization:

1. [Describe] Use Graph? What is the type? (bar chart, pie chart, radar chart ...) **No**
2. [List] Any interaction available on the graph? List them (enable click on numbers, drag on lines, change time/variables...) **No**

#### Interaction Form: 
1. [List] Any information output? list them. (text field, text area, label, plain HTML ...) **No**
2. [List] Any operation option (filters)? **No**
3. [List] Any information input? **No**
4. [List] Interaction with Map? **The user can see the districts, neighborhoods and the buildings, units and projects and center the map in the NYU Stern School. The user can clean the map objects too.**
5. [List] Interaction with data visualization? List them. **No**

##  Build Case  
How can we build and access your project on a Linux/Unix machine if you use external dependencies besides HTML/CSS/Javascript?

> The project don't use any external dependencie, only the libraries
> before mentionated, but their are imported automatically online.

List the dependencies you used, such as python, node.js, etc.  
> - Bootstrap
> - jQuery
> - Google Maps API
> - d3.js

List the steps we should follow to build the project.
> 1. Open the main page (index.html) in your explorer.
> 2. Enjoy it!

## Test Case    

The project was tested in the next browsers:
 - Google Chrome
 - Firefox
 - Safari
